## ** Use the Terraform documentation to build out your code. **

## 1. Create a highly available two-tier AWS architecture containing the following:
##   A. 3 Public Subnets
##   B. 3 Private Subnets
##   C. 1 Bastion Host in a public subnet
##   D. Auto Scaling Group for Web Server (in private subnets)
##   E. Internet-facing Application Load Balancer targeting Web Server Auto Scaling Group

## 2. Deploy this using Terraform Cloud as a CI/CD tool to check your build.

## 3. Use module blocks for ease of use and re-usability.

## NOTE: all code should be in module blocks, not resource blocks

## 1. Deploy this using Terraform Cloud as a CI/CD tool to check your build.

## Yes we know you have not used Terraform Cloud but this is a real world scenario where you will be faced with using a tool you are not too familiar with.

## NOTE: DO NOT FORGET TO SET YOUR  ACCESS KEY, SECRET ACCESS KEY AND REGION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN TERRAFORM CLOUD
